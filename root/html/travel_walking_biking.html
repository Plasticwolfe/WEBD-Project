		<h2>Spring, Summer &#38; Fall Travel:</h2>
        <p>Walking is an important part of student life, and can be a great source of daily exercise if you happen to live far enough away, yet still a managable distance! Travelling can change depending on weather as well; we've outlined the spring, summer and fall advice below, <a href="#">Winter Travel</a> is further down! We've outlined some basic tips and tricks below; as well as a basic walking map for the COGS campus specifically!</p>

    	<p>You can see our map for recommended travel distances colour-coded on the map below! If you're within the red, we 								recommend you walk (Less than 1.5KM), while if you're in the purple we recommend you bike (1.5-3KM)! If you're not on the map, we recommend you <a href="#">Travel By Bus</a>, or <a href="#">Carpool</a>!</p>

    <aside id="walkbike_winter">
		<h2>Winter Travel:</h2>
		<p>As for walking and biking in winter, we recommend doing regular research on the upcoming weather (check out below for the current weather, and our <a href="#">Weather Page</a> for a full weekly weather update!, and limit yourself to half the recommend distance as you would in summer, 750m for walking, and 1.5km for biking. We highly recommend you <a href="#">Travel By Bus</a>, or <a href="#">Carpool</a> instead, however. </p>

    <article id="walkbike_tips">
		<h2>Shortcuts and Tips:</h2>
    	<p>For walking around the NSCC COGS area, we highly recommend you check out the Snowmobiling/Walking trail near the Lawrencetown Firestation! It travels from Middleton all the way into Lawrencetown in the Spring, Summer, and Fall; however don't use it during the winter, as Snowmobiles call it home!</p>
