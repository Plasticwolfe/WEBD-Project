		<h3>What is this Site?</h3>
		<p><em>Team Slumber Party</em> was tasked with creating a website for <em>WEBD1000</em> that could be used by students currently attending (or thinking about attending) NSCC COGS Campus! Our group decided on a website that students could use to find better travel arrangements, learn about bus routes, and perspective areas to find apartments based on the need to walk or bike to school each day. We've also included useful information such as current weather in the area, cancellations and traffic updates, and even a forum to post Carpool information for those willing to give up a seat in their car each day!</p>
